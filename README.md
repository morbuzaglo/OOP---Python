# OOP - DIRECTED WEIGHTED GRAPH -> in PYTHON!
As a part of the "Object Oriented Programming", we created a project the implements the ideas and algorithms on directed weighted graph. the purpose is to expirience with python, and compare our results to "NetworkX" (python) library and to our java code that implements the same ideas.

## MAIN ALGORITHMS:
- `shortest_path` - returns (float, list), float -> the shortest distance from one node to another, list -> of the nodes in the way on the shortest path.

- `connected_component` - returns a list the contains all the nodes that on the same SCC of a specific nodes.

- `connected_components` - returns all the SCC lists in the graph.
